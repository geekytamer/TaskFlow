## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#29ABE2) for trustworthiness and clarity.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF).
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9933) to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif providing both a modern look with some warmth and personality. This single font selection will provide the app a quiet feel.
- Use simple, outline-style icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons for a clean and modern look.
- Use a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment. Divide the dashboard into logical sections.
- Subtle transitions and animations on task status changes and page navigation to provide visual feedback and improve user experience.
